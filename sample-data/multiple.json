The ASP.NET Core fails to properly sanitize the _Web Request Handler_ component, allowing an attacker to spoof web requests and bypass authentication.\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `System.Net.Http` to version 4.1.2, 4.3.2 or higher.\n\n## References\n- [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/2017-0256)\n- [Microsoft Security Advisory](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/4021279.aspx)\n- [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/239)\n",
